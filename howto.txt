First we need a struct with the following fields:
All these structs have to be linked in a linked list.

	Name
	Pid
	PPid
	Linked list 	// with all the direct related childs

1. Iterate through all of the directorys and their status files 
2. Look first for Name, Pid and PPid. 
3. Then we iterate through the linked list of all the processes
4. At each step we compare the Pid of our new process to the PPid of the process in the linked list
   - if the two numbers are the same, then add the node of our newly inspected process to the linked list of all the 
     children this other process has

5. When there are no more processes left, we start to print them to the screen
6. We start printing the process with PPid = 0, i.e. init, systemd, etc
7. We add this string " |-> " to the output and print the first child of the process with Pid 1
8. We now continue to the child. If the child has children, we print " |-> " and go to this child's children etc
   - if the child doesnt have children we put a newline, and strlen from the parent spaces, " |-> " and start with the 
     new children and so on
